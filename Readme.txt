Alita - Artificial Language Intelligent Tasking Assistant (A.L.I.T.A)

Alita is a voice-activated intelligent personal assistant that can do a wide range of tasks, from simple ones like opening apps or browsing the web to more complex ones like doing computations and retrieving weather information. To provide a rich, interactive experience, the project makes use of external APIs, image recognition, text-to-voice synthesis, and speech recognition.

Qualities:

- Voice Recognition: Capable of comprehending voice commands with a sensitivity that can be adjusted.
  
- Text-to-Speech (TTS): Provides synthesised speech in response to user enquiries.
  
- Wikipedia Search: Uses user queries to retrieve pertinent information from Wikipedia.
  
- Web Browsing: Opening and searching websites such as YouTube, Google, and others.
  
- Application Management: Starts and stops programs such as Google Chrome, Notepad, Paint, and others.
  
- Image Recognition (PyAutoGUI): Used in image recognition for GUI-based tasks, such as finding pictures on the screen.
  
- Task Automation: Capable of carrying out standard operations like launching weather programs, capturing screenshots, and even shutting down the computer.
  
- Math Computations: Voice input is supported for simple arithmetic computations.
  
- Weather Information: Uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather information.
  
- Music Playback: Selects songs at random from the local music catalogue.
  
- IP Address Retrieval: Uses the ipify API to retrieve and read the public IP address.
  
- Logging: Keeps track of every action for debugging and documentation purposes.

Utilised Technologies:

- Python: A fundamental programming language.
  
- Speech Recognition: To translate spoken words into written language.
  
- pyttsx3: For turning text back into speech.
  
- PyAutoGUI: For image recognition and GUI automation.
  
- Wikipedia API: Used to retrieve data from Wikipedia.
  
- OpenWeatherMap API: Weather data can be retrieved via this API.
  
- OpenCV: For visual tasks and webcam access.
  
- Requests: To handle HTTP requests (such as retrieving an IP address).

- JSON: Used to store user preferences and memory.
